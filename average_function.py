# average_function.py
# For this exercise the pseudo-code is required (in this same file) 
# Write a function that calculates the average of the values of
# any vector of 10 numbers 
# Each single value of the vector should be read from the keyboard
# and added to a list.
# Print the input vector and its average 
# Define separate functions for the input and for calculating the average

'''
pseudo-code:


'''

create list = ()
range (10)

for i in the range(10):
add at the list the input ('insert a number')
now the list contains the value enter by the users, so we have list=(n1, n2, n3, n4, n5, n6, n7, n8, n9, n10)
for i in range(10)(the range can be equal to the lenght of the list) and sum=0:
sum = +i
then calculate the average
average= sum+ lenght of the list
print average
